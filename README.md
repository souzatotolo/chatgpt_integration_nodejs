API integration with nodejs and chatGPT-3.5 API

# ChatGPT API Example

This is a simple example of how to use the ChatGPT API provided by OpenAI. It demonstrates how to interact with the ChatGPT model to generate responses to user inputs.

## Prerequisites

Before running the code, make sure you have the following:

- Node.js installed
- OpenAI API key


Dont forget  to create a `.env` file in the project directory and add your OpenAI API key:
API_KEY=your-api-key

The application will prompt you to enter input. After you provide your input, the application will send it to the ChatGPT API and display the generated response.

## Limitations and Customization

Please note that the current implementation uses the GPT-3.5-turbo model, and there may be limitations on the length of the input and output. Feel free to customize the code and experiment with different models or configurations based on your requirements.
